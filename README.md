# MusicBTW
Music bot penned in Python and capable of playing media from Youtube with input
from Spotify, will be capable of dealing with playlists, albums, and individual
tracks.

Currently rewriting to use [Lavalink](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink)
to handle voice shenanigans until such a time as they're understood by mere mortals.
