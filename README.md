# MusicBTW
Music bot penned in Python and capable of playing media from Youtube with input
from Spotify, will be capable of dealing with playlists, albums, and individual
tracks.

Currently rewriting to use [Lavalink](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink)
to handle voice shenanigans until such a time as they're understood by mere mortals.

🙌🙌 Wowsers, thanks 👍 for considering 🤔 contributing 📑 to the project 👷‍♂️.
😀 Since the bot 🤖 requires a fair 🎡 few dependencies 📚, it's recommended 🤓
that 👉 you test the bot 🤖 from within docker-compose 🐳.
Make sure 🤗 any additions ➕ to the codebase 👨‍💻 go in their own branches 🌳,
that way we can keep things clean 🧹.

See 👀 below 👇 for the feature hitlist 🎯!

### Feature Hitlist 🎯
- [ ] Queue shuffle command
- [ ] Loop current track command
- [ ] Loop queue command
- [ ] Slash command implementation (moderately dank)
- [ ] Improving Spotify based track pulls with cross-correlation and that (highly dank)

If you like the sound of one of these to work on, we'll do a bit of that "ReqUirEmeNTs AnAlYSIs" so there's a clear target.
